# Homework Week 1

## Building our first real web application

Yes! We're finally going to build our first actual Single Page Application (after completing this week's homework, you're officially a front-end web developer :nerd_face:). We'll start with the basics, and add more fancy stuff and rewrite parts as we learn more in the coming weeks.

Because we're actually going to build an entire application, this week's homework is more extensive and challenging than previous homework. **Please read the instructions below carefully and follow them with great attention to detail**. This is also an important part of being a developer!

## The application: GitHub HYF Repo Browser

Over the coming weeks, we are going to write an application that uses the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/guides/getting-started/).

This application should display information about the available [HYF GitHub repositories](https://github.com/hackyourfuture). The functionalities we would like to see in your application are as follows:

- The user should be able to select a repository from a list of available repositories.
- The application should display high-level information about the selected repository and show a list of its contributors.
- When clicking on the name of the selected repository the GitHub page for the corresponding repository should be opened in a new browser tab.
- When clicking on a contributor, the GitHub page for the contributor should be opened in a new browser tab.

Figure 1 below shows an example of what your application could look like. Note that this is just an example. If you find it boring or unimaginative, please improve on it! On the other hand, a simpler version is OK too, so long as you implement the expected functionality.

A live version of this application can be found here: http://hyf-github.netlify.com/

## The GitHub API

Aside from the GitHub front-end that we all use, GitHub also exposes its content through an API, which any application can freely use. Let's have a look at it.

You can fetch a list of HYF repositories through this API endpoint ([What is an API Endpoint?](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/what-is-an-api-endpoint)):

```
https://api.github.com/orgs/HackYourFuture/repos?per_page=100
```

> Note the `?per_page=100` at the end of the above URL. That's a [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string). In short, it *passes additional information to its request to the API*, through its url, rather than the request body. This particular query string tells the API we want to see `100` results `per_page`. The GitHub API [understands this](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/traversing-with-pagination/#changing-the-number-of-items-received). We'll see query strings in more detail when we talk about REST later on in the course.

If you open this URL in the browser you will receive JSON data about the available HYF repositories. Try it now! You'll just see the JSON returned as text. That's a bit difficult to digest, isn't it? If you open the Developer Console (F12) though, and go to the 'Network' tab and hit refresh (F5), you'll get a neatly structured representation where you can 'browse' the result.

![Devtools GitHub API repositories result](./assets/api_result_devtools.png)

Still, this is lot of data, but don't be overwhelmed: you won't need 99% of it for this homework. The interesting properties are for instance `name`, `full_name` and `description`. There are also many properties that contain URLs, which can be used to navigate to detailed information about certain aspects of the repository. Go ahead and play around with them! One of these url's that you'll be using in this application, next week, is `contributors_url`: you can use the value of this property to fetch a list of contributors.

> As with most public API's, GitHub's API is very well and extensively documented. You can literally learn everything about it from just reading their documentation. However, API documentation can be daunting. For this homework it is not necessary to study the GitHub API documentation.

## Coding Style

Writing code is easy - writing [*clean code*](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) is hard. Books have been written about it. [Literally](https://www.bol.com/nl/f/clean/9200000033313462/?country=BE). Always remember that code is written once, but read dozens of times, including by you. Spare your future self a headache!

Clean code consists of proper naming, but also of more general 'styling'.

There are many ways we can 'style' our code - and there's an equal amount of [style guides](https://codeburst.io/5-javascript-style-guides-including-airbnb-github-google-88cbc6b2b7aa). Certain aspects are certainly debatable, however, over the years, there has been quite some consensus about many things. In the JavaScript world, the most widely used style guide - which you'll find used in many public repositories on GitHub and which you'll encounter in many companies - is the one from the Airbnb team (it has 82000 stars, making it one of GitHub's most popular repo's ever). That's the one we'll also be using during the course of HYF.

Here it is: the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

While you do not need to read this guide in detail, it is recommended that you review sections 1-8, 12-13, 15-21 and 23.

Luckily, however, we can set-up any modern editor, including (especially) VS Code (:heart_eyes:), to help us follow these rules, highlighting warnings and errors. We'll run through how to set that up later in this guide. An additional check will be done when you submit your homework as a pull request on GitHub.

## Homework schedule

You will be working on the same application during the next three weeks. For each week you will need to create a new Git branch, as listed in the Table 1 below.

| Week | Branch  | Assignment |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- |
|  1   | `week1` | - By Wednesday: Fetch the HYF repositories and log their display names to the console.<br/>- By Friday: Populate a `<select>` list with the repository names; allow the user to pick one, and display some of its details, like in the example. |
|  2   | `week2` | Based on the `week1` branch:<br>- When a repository is selected, also load the contributors. Display a loading indicator while loading.<br>- Style the UI, and make it responsive.|
|  3   | `week3` | Based on the `week2` branch:<br>- Refactor the application to use ES6 Classes and async/await.<br>- Make the app ARIA-compliant.<br />- Marvel at your first application. |

# Instructions

## Part 1 - <small>Set-up your environment</small>
**Deadline: Wednesday**

- [ ] Fork our class' fork of the JavaScript3 repository to your own GitHub account. Yes, you'll be creating a fork of a fork of a fork:

   ```
   - Main HYF Javascript 3 repository: https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript3
     - Belgium HYF fork: https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/JavaScript3
       - Our class' (Rob's) fork: https://github.com/segersrobbert/JavaScript3
         - Your fork here.
   ```

- [ ] Clone the fork to your laptop.
- [ ] Open the newly created `JavaScript3` folder from the cloned repository in VS Code.
- [ ] Install the [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/) extension in VS Code. This extension will highlight and inform you of any violations of the style guide, and allow you to auto-fix a lot of issues. You should probably also already install the [**EditorConfig for VS Code**](https://editorconfig.org/) plugin. Although it's not required in our case because we all use the same editor, it will come in handy when you work on public projects in the future.

- [ ] Open a Terminal window in VS Code or elsewhere, and **from the main JavaScript3 folder**, type the following command to install the airbnb style guide and ESLint tools as required for the homework:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

- [ ] Create a new branch for the week 1 homework with the following command:

   ```
   git checkout -b week1
   ```

## Part 2 - <small>Call the API</small>
**Deadline: Wednesday evening**

You'll create your application inside the `homework` folder. It already has 3 basic, but completely empty files ready: an html, a css and an index file.

- [ ] Your first task is to create the basic content for these files. Reference the css and javascript files in the correct way. Give your application a nice title.

- [ ] Write the javascript code that, as soon as the page loads, fetches the HYF repositories.

  > *Hints*:
  > - How do you execute codeas soon as the page loads?
  > - How do we handle the *response* of the call?
  > - How do we then *interpret* the body of the response?

- [ ] Log the names of the returned repositories to the console; one next to the other.

  > *Hint*: map.

## Part 3 - <small>Select list, repo details</small>
**Deadline: Friday evening**

- [ ] As in the example, in your application's header, create and populate a `<select>` list with all the repository's names.

  > *Hint*: map again.

- [ ] When the user selects a repository, display its details, nicely formatted. Display at least its name, a description, its number of forks, and when it was last updated, nicely formatted. Bonus points for nice icons. Even more bonus points for a conditional, dynamic nice icon for one of its properties, like `has_wiki`. Or be even more creative. Everything's possible.

  > *Hints*:
  > - How do you handle a user selecting a value in the `<select>` list?
  > - In what *scope* will you have to declare the result of the call, so that you can access it later on?
  > - How will you find the selected repository in the complete array? Hints: option value, filter
  > - How to convert a [ISO 8601](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date string into a JavaScript `Date` (we haven't seen this yet, so Google!), and then format it as a human-readable *locale date string* and *locale time string*?


# Handing in your homework

If necessary, review the instructions how to [Hand in homework](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/homework_pr.md) using GitHub pull request.

To test whether your code will be accepted when you submit your homework as a pull request you need to ensure that it does not contain ESLint errors. Open a terminal window in VS Code (or elsewhere) in the main JavaScript3 directory and type the following command:

```
npm test
```

If any errors or warnings are reported by this command you need to fix them before submitting a pull request.

In addition, check for the following:

- Have you removed all commented out code (should never be present in a PR)?
- Do the variable, function and argument names you created follow the [Naming Conventions](../../../../fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md)?
- Is your code well-formatted (see [Code Formatting](../../../../fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/code_formatting.md))?

If the answer is 'yes' to the preceding questions you are ready to follow these instructions:

1. Push your `week1` branch to GitHub:

   ```
   git push -u origin week1
   ```

2. Create a pull request for your `week1` branch against our class' (Rob's) fork.
